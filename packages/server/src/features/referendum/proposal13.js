    <p>经 ChainX 议会与 Gate.io 交易所深入沟通，现针对 PCX 上线 Gate.io 交易所形式以及经费等相关事宜发起社区公投。是否支持 ChainX 支付 50000-100000 USDT 等值 PCX 代币用于上线 Gate.io 交易所，细则如下：</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>1. 应 Gate.io 交易所要求，PCX 将以投票上币的形式在 Gate.io 开展上币工作；</li>
        <li>
            <p>2. Gate.io 投票上币形式分为两种：单币投票和双币投票，项目最终上币投票形式由 Gate.io 交易所决定。</p>
            <ul>
                <li>若以单币形式参与上币投票，项目需获得大于 1000 万 GT 投票则成功在 Gate.io 上线交易。</li>
                <li>若以双币形式参与上币投票，则两个项目进行 PK，由平台用户投票选择倾向的项目进行投票，活动结束后，获胜项目将在 Gate.io 上线交易。</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>3. PCX 若在上币投票环节胜出，则需向 Gate.io 支付 50000-100000 USDT 等值 PCX 代币，用于活动空投奖励，此外不需额外向交易所支付上币费，该费用将全部由参与投票上币用户按比例瓜分。</li>
        <li>4. 若当期投票落选，则不需要支付空投代币，并可继续参加下一期投票活动；连续三轮投票落选即上币失败，Gate.io 将退还项目所有空投代币。</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>注：支付 PCX 代币为活动经费，将全部用于社区空投，具体金额将在本次提案通过后由议会与 Gate.io 进一步洽谈，结果届时将公布社区，具体投票上币规则及交易所相关介绍，可参阅 Gate.io 官网相关介绍。</p>

    <p>After in-depth communication with Gate.io Exchange, a community referendum is now being launched for funding and form of PCX's listing on the Gate.io Exchange: Whether or not to support a payment in PCX token that equal to 50k -100k USDT for listing on Gate.io exchange. Detail rules are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Requested by Gate.io exchange, PCX will be listed on Gate.io in the form of voting;</li>
        <li>
            <p>2. There are two ways for voting on Gate.io: single currency voting and dual currency voting. The specific voting method for the project’s listing is determined by the Gate.io exchange;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If voting in the form of a single currency, the project needs to get more than 10 million GT (the platform token of gate.io exchange) votes to succeed.</li>
                <li>If voting in the form of dual currency, two projects will have a PK, and the platform users will vote for their preferred project. After the event is over, the winner will be listed on Gate.io.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>3. If PCX wins in the voting process of listing, then a 50k -100k USDT equivalent PCX tokens need pay to Gate.io for the airdrop rewards. There is no additional listing fee need pay to the exchange. This fee will be paid proportionally to the users who vote for listing PCX.</li>
        <li>4. If loses the vote in the current period, PCX needs NOT to pay the airdrop tokens, and can continue to participate in the next round of voting. If failed in three consecutive rounds, the listing would fail, and Gate.io will refund all the airdrop tokens.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: All PCX tokens in payment would be used as activity funds, that is community airdrops. The specific amount will be further discussed by the Parliament and Gate.io after this proposal is passed. The results will be published to the community. Specific voting rules and exchange related introduction, please refer to the related documents on Gate.io official website</p>
