    "title": "Proposal No. 1: Strengthening restrictions on self-collateralized nodes",
    "desc": "This proposal suggests that a node can only receive up to 10 times the votes it stores as collaterals. That is to say, when a user votes on a node, if the total number of votes after voting exceeds 10 times that of the votes it stores as collaterals, the voting fails to take place, and the node has to increase the collateralized votes for a higher upper limit. For example, the number of votes node A stores as collaterals is 1000PCX, and the total number of votes is 9000PCX (including 8000PCX from users). Node A can receive another 1000PCX from users at most. If user B attempts to vote 1200PCX to A, the voting will fail.",
    "reason": "1.To correspond the interests of the node operator with the revenues generated by the node, which will lay the foundation for more stringent punishment mechanisms like double-signing in the future; 2.To boost the confidence of the community users to the nodes and promote the sustainable development of the ChainX ecosystem.",
    "rule": "1. Users’ voting power is quantified by the number PCX in the voting account; 2. Users can change their votes at any time during the referendum, and the last one is valid; 3. After the referendum, if the number of votes in favor of the proposal is more than that against it, the proposal will pass, otherwise the proposal will not pass. ",

In other words, users only have one opportunity to switch their votes in 3 days. Or when users switch their votes, it must be more than 3 days from the last switching time, otherwise the switching cannot take place.",

One seat is reserved for the PolkaX team  for the role it plays in developing and upgrading the system. Another 10 seats will be added.\n2. The 10 new seats will be held by credible nodes with intention to run for the parliament, that have secured the top 10 spots in terms of votes. Nodes that intent on bribing their way through the election will be disqualified.\n3. Given the fact that the total number of votes a node receives changes all the time, but the parliament seats should be held by a fixed group for a certain period of time, so each parliament term only lasts one month. After one month, elections will be held to select new nodes with high ratings and credibility.\nThis proposal is approved by the preliminary electoral group consisting of seven nodes cha.in, hashquak, wetez, nodeeasy, buildlinks, polkaworld, sssnodes and the PolkaX team as well as two community representatives, with no one voting against it. Now a referendum will be held in the community. If passed, it will be implemented.",
